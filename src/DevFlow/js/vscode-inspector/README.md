# MAUI DevFlow Inspector for VS Code

Live-inspect and drive a running .NET MAUI app from VS Code. This MAUI DevFlow Inspector host
embeds the existing DevFlow Web Inspector, including the visual tree, screenshot overlay, property
editing, workflow recording, and click-to-XAML navigation.

## Requirements

1. Install the preview `Microsoft.Maui.Cli` global tool and DevFlow agent packages.
2. Add and start the DevFlow agent in a Debug build of your MAUI app.
3. Launch the app so it registers with the local DevFlow broker.
4. Run **MAUI DevFlow: Open Inspector** from the Command Palette.

The extension requires VS Code 1.125 or later. It runs in the workspace extension host so local,
Remote, and WSL workspaces connect to the broker beside the app tooling.

## Configuration

- `mauiDevflow.brokerPort` — explicit DevFlow broker port; `0` auto-discovers via
  `~/.mauidevflow/broker.json`.
- `mauiDevflow.openLocation` — where the Inspector panel opens: `auto` (default, opens beside the
  active editor when one is open, otherwise in the active group), `beside`, or `active`.
- `mauiDevflow.publishDiagnostics` — preview option that publishes current runtime Problems and
  findings from explicit Layout scans at uniquely resolved workspace source locations.

## Copilot and source integration

- Use the `@devflow` Chat Participant:
  - `@devflow /inspect`
  - `@devflow /diagnose-selection`
  - `@devflow /explain-problem`
  - `@devflow /create-test`
- **Copilot** opens a context menu for the selected MAUI element, the loaded workflow, both
  together, or the current Data snapshot. Selected elements use the
  `maui-devflow_getSelectedElement` language-model tool.
- The Data paperclip adds a bounded, redacted Logs, Network, Preferences, Device, Sensors, file
  metadata, or native Alerts snapshot through `maui-devflow_getDataSnapshot`; Copilot can use the
  included DevFlow MCP tool names for fresher or deeper follow-up.
- **Open source** navigates to generated XAML source locations when Debug source maps are enabled.
- **Record** creates a portable Markdown workflow that can be replayed by DevFlow.
- **Workflow** loads saved tests from the project's `maui-tests` directory or an OS-selected
  Markdown file and shows replay results in the shared Inspector panel.
- The extension contributes the local `maui devflow mcp` server to compatible VS Code hosts, so
  the broader DevFlow automation tools are available without duplicating them as extension tools.
- Versioned `vscode://maui-labs.maui-devflow-inspector/open?...` links can focus a current local
  agent, element, Problem, run, or Inspector view. Links never carry broker tokens or evidence
  payloads and fail closed when their target is stale.

When preview diagnostics are enabled, DevFlow diagnostics offer **Inspect live control**,
**Explain with Copilot**, and **Open selected runtime element** Code Actions. Clearing editor
diagnostics does not clear the running app's bounded Problems history.
