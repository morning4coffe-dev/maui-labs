# Broker Daemon

Microsoft.Maui.DevFlow includes a **broker daemon** that coordinates port assignment and agent
discovery across multiple running apps. It eliminates port collisions when debugging
several MAUI apps (or the same app on different platforms) simultaneously.

## Overview

The broker is a lightweight background process that:

- **Assigns unique ports** to each MAUI agent from a shared pool (10223–10899)
- **Tracks running agents** so the CLI can discover them without manual `--agent-port` flags
- **Detects disconnections instantly** via persistent WebSocket connections
- **Starts and stops automatically** — you rarely need to manage it directly

```

**Key design choice**: the broker is a **thin registry**, not a command proxy. The CLI
discovers an agent's port from the broker, then connects directly to the agent's own
HTTP server. This means zero overhead on the inspection/debugging hot path, and no
changes to the existing CLI command set.

## How It Works

### Agent Startup

When a MAUI app starts with `AddMicrosoft.Maui.DevFlowAgent()`:

1. The agent reads its **project identity** from assembly metadata injected at build time
   (`Microsoft.Maui.DevFlowProject` = absolute path to `.csproj`, `Microsoft.Maui.DevFlowTfm` = e.g.
   `net10.0-maccatalyst`).

2. It attempts to connect to the broker at `ws://localhost:19223/ws/agent` and sends a
   registration message:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "register",
     "project": "/Users/dev/MyApp/MyApp.csproj",
     "tfm": "net10.0-maccatalyst",
     "platform": "MacCatalyst",
     "appName": "MyApp"
   }
   ```

3. The broker assigns a free port from the pool (10223–10899), verifying the port is
   actually available via a TCP bind test. It responds:
   ```json
   { "type": "registered", "id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6", "port": 10223 }
   ```

4. The agent starts its HTTP server on the assigned port (10223 in this example).

   **Note:** If the agent already has an HTTP server running (e.g., from a `.mauidevflow`
   config or a previous broker connection), it sends `currentPort` in the registration
   message. The broker uses that port instead of allocating a new one from the pool.

5. The WebSocket connection stays open. The broker uses it as a liveness signal —
   if the connection drops, the agent is immediately marked as disconnected and
   its port is released.

### CLI Discovery

When you run a CLI command like `maui devflow ui status`:

1. The CLI calls `EnsureBrokerRunningAsync()` to make sure the broker is alive
   (starting it if necessary).

2. It queries the broker's HTTP API to find the right agent:
   - If run from a project directory, it hashes the `.csproj` path to match by identity
   - If only one agent is connected, it auto-selects
   - If multiple agents match the same project (different TFMs), it auto-selects if
     there's only one match
   - If multiple agents are connected and can't be narrowed down, it prints the agent
     list to stderr and falls back to `.mauidevflow` / default port. This is non-interactive
     — the output is designed so an AI agent (or human) can see the available ports and
     re-run with `--agent-port <port>`.

3. Once the agent's port is known, the CLI connects directly to the agent's HTTP
   server — all existing commands (`tree`, `screenshot`, `tap`, `logs`, etc.) work
   unchanged.

### Port Assignment

The broker assigns ports from a pool of **10223–10899** (677 ports). This range was
chosen to avoid collisions with ports in legacy `.mauidevflow` config files (which
typically use 9223–9899). For each new agent:

1. Iterate from 10223 upward
2. Skip ports already assigned to other connected agents
3. For each candidate, perform a real TCP bind test (start a `TcpListener`, then
   immediately stop it) to verify the port is actually free
4. Assign the first port that passes both checks

This ensures no collisions even with non-Microsoft.Maui.DevFlow processes using ports in the range.

### Agent Identity

Each agent instance is identified by a **deterministic hash**:

```
ID = SHA256( absolute_csproj_path + "|" + TFM )[:12]
```

For example, `/Users/dev/MyApp/MyApp.csproj|net10.0-maccatalyst` → `7ff0e6fd13d9`.

This means:
- The **same app on different platforms** (iOS vs Mac Catalyst) gets different IDs
- **Restarting** the same app replaces the old registration (same ID, new WebSocket)
- Different **git worktrees** of the same project get different IDs (different absolute paths)

## Broker Lifecycle

### Automatic Start

The broker starts transparently — you don't need to launch it manually. Both the CLI
and the agent call `EnsureBrokerRunningAsync()` which:

1. **Read state file** (`~/.mauidevflow/broker.json`) for the broker's port hint
2. **TCP connect** to `localhost:{port}` (500ms timeout, <1ms if refused)
3. If alive → use it
4. If not → clean up stale PID, fork a new broker process, poll until ready (5s timeout)

The state file looks like:
```json
{
  "pid": 54321,
  "port": 19223,
  "startedAt": "2026-02-13T01:20:00Z"
}
```

### Idle Timeout

The broker automatically exits after **5 minutes** with:
- Zero connected agents, AND
- No CLI HTTP requests in the last 5 minutes

A timer checks every 30 seconds. The timeout resets on any agent connection or CLI query.
This means the broker stays alive as long as any app is running, and lingers briefly after
the last app exits in case you're about to rebuild and relaunch.

### Manual Commands

For troubleshooting, you can manage the broker directly:

```bash
maui devflow broker start              # Start detached (same as auto-start)
maui devflow broker start --foreground # Start in current terminal (debug mode)
maui devflow broker stop               # Graceful shutdown
maui devflow broker status             # Show PID, port, uptime, connected agents
maui devflow broker log                # Show last 50 lines of broker.log
```

### Listing Connected Agents

```bash
maui devflow list
```

Shows all agents currently registered with the broker:

```
ID             App                  Platform       TFM                      Port   Uptime
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7ff0e6fd13d9   MauiTodo             MacCatalyst    net10.0-maccatalyst      10223  2m 15s
a3c9e1f20b44   MauiTodo             Android        net10.0-android          10224  1m 30s
```

### Multiple Agents — Disambiguation

When multiple agents are connected and the CLI can't determine which one to target
(no `.csproj` in the current directory, or multiple TFMs for the same project), it
prints the agent table to stderr and falls back to the config file port:

```
Multiple agents connected. Use --agent-port to specify which one:

ID             App                  Platform       TFM                      Port
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7ff0e6fd13d9   MauiTodo             MacCatalyst    net10.0-maccatalyst      10223
a3c9e1f20b44   MauiTodo             Android        net10.0-android          10224

Example: maui devflow ui status --agent-port <port>
```

This output is **non-interactive** by design. AI agents can parse it and re-run
the command with the correct `--agent-port` flag. Humans can read the table and
pick the right port.

**Auto-resolution priority:**

1. `--agent-port` flag → always wins (explicit)
2. Exact match by project `.csproj` + TFM → single result
3. Match by project `.csproj` only → single result (any TFM)
4. Single agent connected → auto-select
5. Multiple agents, ambiguous → print list, fall back to `.mauidevflow` / default

## Imported artifact trust

The broker has a separate, local-only artifact-trust surface for bounded diagnostic imports:

```text
POST /api/artifact-trust/import?kind=flow-run|mauitrace
GET  /api/artifact-trust/{imported-artifact-id}/status
GET  /api/artifact-trust/{imported-artifact-id}/projection
POST /api/artifact-trust/{imported-artifact-id}/bind-local-reproduction
```

An import receives a fresh opaque `iat_...` ID and capability token. The token is required in the
`X-Maui-Artifact-Capability` header for status, projection, and local-reproduction binding. The
store is memory-only, count/TTL bounded, has no list endpoint, and never returns raw report/ZIP
bytes. POST import is read-only: it does not execute, replay, write a workspace file, or append
repair history.

Imports start `untrusted`. Internal report/ZIP hashes establish integrity only. A trusted caller
can use the provider-neutral Testing policy to verify provenance separately, but an `attested`
artifact still cannot create a repair/source proposal. Binding requires a newly completed
broker-owned local run and current flow/app/target/failure expectations; only a matching
`locally-reproduced` binding passes the future proposal gate.

## Graceful Fallback

The broker is **optional**. If it can't start or isn't available, everything falls
back to the existing behavior:

### Agent Fallback Chain

```
1. Broker assigns port           → use broker-assigned port
2. Broker unavailable            → read Microsoft.Maui.DevFlowPort from assembly metadata
                                   (compiled from .mauidevflow config at build time)
3. No assembly metadata          → use default port 9223
```

### CLI Fallback Chain

```
1. Query broker for agent port   → connect directly to agent
2. Broker unavailable            → read port from .mauidevflow in current directory
3. No .mauidevflow file          → use default port 9223
4. Explicit --agent-port flag    → always overrides everything
```

No functionality is lost without the broker — you just can't run multiple apps
simultaneously without manual port management.

## Agent Reconnection

The agent automatically reconnects to the broker in two scenarios:

1. **Broker restarts or WebSocket drops** — reconnection starts immediately
2. **Initial connection fails** (broker not yet running) — reconnection starts in the background
   while the agent falls back to its config/default port

Backoff schedule:

| Attempt | Delay  |
|---------|--------|
| 1       | 2s     |
| 2       | 5s     |
| 3       | 10s    |
| 4+      | 15s    |

Retries continue **indefinitely** — the agent never gives up trying to reach the broker.
When reconnecting after the HTTP server is already running, the agent sends `currentPort`
in the registration so the broker reuses its existing port rather than assigning a new one.

The HTTP server stays up throughout reconnection attempts — only broker discovery is affected.

## Platform Connectivity

| Platform       | Agent → Broker              | CLI → Agent               |
|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mac Catalyst   | `localhost:19223` direct     | `localhost:{port}` direct |
| Windows        | `localhost:19223` direct     | `localhost:{port}` direct |
| Linux/GTK      | `localhost:19223` direct     | `localhost:{port}` direct |
| iOS Simulator  | Shares host network, direct  | `localhost:{port}` direct |
| Android Emu    | `adb reverse tcp:19223 tcp:19223` | `adb forward tcp:{port} tcp:{port}` |

For Android, the two directions are different: the app reaches the host broker through
`adb reverse tcp:19223 tcp:19223`, while the host CLI reaches the in-emulator agent
through `adb forward tcp:{port} tcp:{port}`. The CLI prepares these mappings
automatically when it can select a single online Android device. If multiple devices are
online, pass `--device <serial>` or set `ANDROID_SERIAL` so it does not guess.

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.mauidevflow/broker.json` | Local broker state (PID, port, start time, iframe embed token, and a separate native-host approval token). Written on start, deleted on stop. The approval token must never enter an Inspector URL, DOM, or webview message. |
| `~/.mauidevflow/broker.log`  | Rolling log file (auto-truncated at 1MB). |

## Broker HTTP API

The broker exposes a simple HTTP API on port 19223 for CLI and diagnostic use:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check. Returns `{"status":"ok","agents":N}` |
| `/api/agents` | GET | List all connected agents with full metadata |
| `/api/workflow-runs/capabilities` | GET | Discover bounded workflow-run coordination support |
| `/api/workflow-runs/start` | POST | Start one validated replay for an explicit agent instance |
| `/api/workflow-runs/{runId}/status` | POST | Read a run using its capability token |
| `/api/workflow-runs/{runId}/cancel` | POST | Request cancellation using its capability token |
| `/api/shutdown` | POST | Request graceful shutdown |
| `/ws/agent` | WebSocket | Agent registration endpoint |

### GET /api/agents Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": "7ff0e6fd13d9",
    "instanceId": "9a0dcb5664d643d3bc49d8ae692c71d6",
    "project": "/Users/dev/MyApp/MyApp.csproj",
    "tfm": "net10.0-maccatalyst",
    "platform": "MacCatalyst",
    "appName": "MyApp",
    "port": 10223,
    "connectedAt": "2026-02-13T01:20:01Z"
  }
]
```

### Workflow-run API

Workflow runs are broker-owned, bounded replays of a canonical `maui-test` flow. They are
not a device lifecycle, reset, repair, or source-editing API.

1. Read `GET /api/workflow-runs/capabilities`.
2. Select an agent from `/api/agents` and send both its `id` and current `instanceId`.
3. Send `POST /api/workflow-runs/start` with an `idempotencyKey`, one of `markdown` or `flow`,
   and an optional bounded `timeoutMs`. A safety-aware caller may additionally send a
   non-executable `plan` and host-observed `context` containing reset, precondition,
   compensator, and independent-oracle evidence.
4. Save the returned `capabilityToken`. It is required in the JSON body for status and cancel unless the Inspector restores the run from its server-held journal after a reload or host handoff.

````json
{
  "agentId": "7ff0e6fd13d9",
  "agentInstanceId": "9a0dcb5664d643d3bc49d8ae692c71d6",
  "idempotencyKey": "caller-generated-opaque-key",
  "markdown": "# Scenario: smoke\n\n```json maui-test\n{\"schema\":2,\"name\":\"smoke\",\"steps\":[]}\n```",
  "timeoutMs": 120000
}
````

The broker validates the flow and evaluates side-effect admission before taking a lease. A
successful start returns HTTP 202 with an opaque `runId`, per-run `capabilityToken`, initial
`queued` state, and an additive `admission` decision. A denied plan/context returns HTTP 409 with
the same structured reasons and acquires neither a lease nor a mutation path. Repeating the same
idempotency key and request digest returns the same run and token; the safety context contributes
to that digest, so using the key with changed evidence returns HTTP 409. One mutating run may
target an agent instance at a time.

#### Dispatch authorization

Authorization is a precondition of the run coordinator, not of any one HTTP route. Every
broker-hosted dispatch surface — the MCP route above, the Inspector workbench
(`POST /api/workbench/run/start`), the Inspector replay bridge, and repair validation — reaches
the device through the same `Start` call, and that call refuses to proceed without an allowing
decision from the broker. A coordinator constructed without an authorizer refuses every start, so
a new dispatch surface inherits the check instead of having to remember it. The decision is taken
against the broker's own view of the target, not the client-supplied ids, and before any
validation, lease, capability token, or idempotency state exists.

Each origin proves something appropriate to what it is:

| Origin | What it must present |
| --- | --- |
| MCP test agent | A live, single-use, human-issued mutation authorization (`authorizationId`) bound to the same agent instance. Refused with HTTP 403. |
| Inspector workbench / replay bridge | A broker-issued dispatch ticket for that exact agent instance and origin, plus the app's mutation lease it already holds. The Inspector is a human at the local UI and has no MCP grant to present. |
| Repair validation | A broker-issued dispatch ticket for that exact agent instance and origin. |

Dispatch tickets are in-process capabilities derived from a per-broker key. They are never
returned to a client, logged, or persisted. Allowed dispatches record a `dispatch-authorized`
lifecycle event on the run journal; refusals are written to the broker log.

`none` requires matching declared/observed preconditions. `test-tenant-resettable` additionally
requires successful app and backend reset evidence with matching seed fingerprints.
`compensated` requires that reset evidence or a successful declared compensator. `non-replayable`
rejects automatic replay and repair validation; only a distinct
`context.manualOneShotAuthorization: true` can admit one human run. Status snapshots and terminal
reports retain the policy, admission reasons, reset/precondition evidence, oracle results, and
`repairEligibility`. Legacy schema-2 manual starts remain supported, but report
`sideEffectPolicy: "unspecified"` and `repairEligibility: false`.

Run states are `queued`, `acquiring-lease`, `preparing`, `running`, `passed`, `failed`,
`cancelled`, `timed-out`, `lease-lost`, and `infrastructure-error`. Terminal status retains the
structured flow run report and first divergence. A reconnect changes `instanceId`; a request for
the old instance is rejected, and an active old-instance run becomes `lease-lost`.

Status and cancellation bodies are deliberately small:

```json
{ "capabilityToken": "returned-only-by-start" }
```

The token coordinates access to an individual run; it is not authorization for arbitrary app
mutation. The broker holds and heartbeats the mutation-lease transaction for the run, disables
mutating transport retries, and ends/releases the lease on every terminal path.

Status snapshots additionally expose bounded `totalSteps`, `completedSteps`, and `currentStepId`
facts for progress UIs. A runner reports a current step only when it has safely entered that
canonical step; a missing or retained prior value never proves that an in-flight mutation did not
complete. Lifecycle messages remain value-free.

The machine-readable contract is
[`broker-workflow-runs-v1.yaml`](spec/broker-workflow-runs-v1.yaml).

## Troubleshooting

### Broker won't start

- **Port 19223 in use?** Check with `lsof -i :19223` (macOS/Linux) or
  `netstat -ano | findstr 19223` (Windows). Kill the conflicting process or
  stop the existing broker with `maui devflow broker stop`.
- **Stale state file?** Delete `~/.mauidevflow/broker.json` and try again.
- **Permissions?** The broker binds to `localhost` only — no admin/root required.

### Agent not appearing in `maui devflow list`

- **Broker running?** Run `maui devflow broker status` to check.
- **App actually started?** The agent registers during app startup. Verify the
  app launched successfully.
- **Firewall?** On Android, run `maui devflow diagnose` and check the `android`
  forwarding section. If multiple devices are online, retry with
  `--device <serial>`.
- **Custom port in code?** If `AddMicrosoft.Maui.DevFlowAgent(o => o.Port = XXXX)` sets a
  non-default port, the agent includes that `currentPort` during broker registration so
  the broker reuses the hardcoded port. If broker registration is unavailable, the CLI
  direct fallback still uses the configured port.

### CLI can't connect to agent

- **Port mismatch?** The broker may have assigned a different port than expected.
  Run `maui devflow list` to see actual port assignments.
- **Agent crashed after registration?** The broker may show the agent briefly
  before detecting the disconnect. Wait a moment and check again.
- **Android?** `maui devflow list`, `maui devflow wait`, auto-resolved agent commands,
  and `maui devflow diagnose` check/repair ADB forwarding when possible. Manually, use
  `adb reverse tcp:19223 tcp:19223` for broker registration and
  `adb forward tcp:{port} tcp:{port}` for the CLI-to-agent HTTP path.

### Broker exits unexpectedly

- Check `~/.mauidevflow/broker.log` for error messages.
- The broker auto-exits after 5 minutes of idle time (no agents, no CLI requests).
  This is normal behavior — it will restart automatically on the next CLI command
  or app launch.
