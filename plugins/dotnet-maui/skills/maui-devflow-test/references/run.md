# Run a Committed Flow

Only a committed Markdown flow with its current plan/flow digest can be
executed. Drafts, chat approval, imported artifacts, and CI status are not
execution authority.

## Preflight

1. Confirm the named committed flow, current revision/digest, and selected
   exact `agentId` plus `agentInstanceId`.
   A checked-in Markdown flow plus matching plan sidecar is a committed disk
   artifact, but `maui_test_run` is intentionally authoring-session-bound and
   cannot route that disk artifact without a session. Never use an unrelated
   active draft to claim that the checked-in flow itself is uncommitted.
2. Read `maui_test_capabilities`; stop rather than routing to an unsupported
   platform or action.
3. Check declared route, build, app instance, seed/backend, locale, display,
   and reset facts. Ask for a reset/seed provider when a repeatable or mutating
   flow needs one.
4. State the verification limitation if no required independent business oracle
   is declared. Do not call the result a verified pass.
5. For `non-replayable`, prepare only a one-shot run review request. It cannot
   authorize a retry, continuation, compensating run, or repair validation.

## Human-Approved Execution

1. Request a separate `run` approval bound to the committed flow and exact
   target (`agentId` and `agentInstanceId`). The scope must match selectors,
   routes, action types/count, values, side effects, build/seed, plan/flow
   revision and digest, and expiry.
2. Direct the human to review the exact scope in Workbench. A chat response
   never replaces this grant. If capabilities report that trusted native-host
   approval is unavailable (including standalone browser or chat), do not
   submit a doomed approval request and do not query authoring-session status
   as a substitute. State that restricted-agent execution is unavailable,
   while keeping the committed disk flow distinct. The separate operator-owned
   `maui devflow flow run` CLI path may execute a valid committed flow outside
   this restricted approval protocol. Describe it as an explicit operator
   action, never as an approval bypass or an agent run.
3. Wait with `maui_test_author await-approval`, then call `maui_test_run` with
   `start` exactly once using a broker-issued, single-use grant only when an
   available native approval client issued that exact bound grant.
4. Use `maui_test_run` with `status` and the run capability until the run is
   terminal. For a terminal failure, call `maui_test_failure` exactly once;
   use `maui_test_trace` for its bounded evidence projection.

If a response is lost, report `unknown-completion`. Never retry automatically;
the human must inspect the outcome and issue a new appropriate authorization if
another action is safe.
Never create a selector repair, repair request, or a second `start` as a
continuation from an uncertain or failed run.

## Result Language

Report completed, failed, cancelled, unknown-completion, or completed but not
independently verified. Do not upgrade simulator, CI, source-only, or
attested-artifact evidence to a physical-device or qualification claim.
Preserve the committed plan's reset, seed, and oracle requirements exactly;
never infer that they are unnecessary merely because the actions look UI-only.
