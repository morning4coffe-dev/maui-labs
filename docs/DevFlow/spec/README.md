# DevFlow protocol spec

This directory contains the canonical DevFlow protocol contract used by the MAUI implementation in this repository.

- `openapi.yaml` defines the versioned HTTP surface under `/api/v1/*` and is the canonical OpenAPI document, including logical storage root discovery and sandboxed file management. The current shared implementation advertises only the `appData` root.
- `broker-workflow-runs-v1.yaml` defines the separate local broker workflow-run surface under
  `/api/workflow-runs/*`. It is intentionally not part of the in-app agent OpenAPI document.
- `asyncapi.yaml` defines the streaming channels under `/ws/v1/*`
- `schemas/` contains the shared payload models
- `examples/` contains representative request and response payloads, including platform job listing and run requests

These spec files are intended to stay framework-agnostic so the same DevFlow contract can be implemented across MAUI and other UI stacks.

Do not commit a generated JSON copy of the OpenAPI document. If a consumer needs JSON, generate it from `openapi.yaml` as part of that workflow so there is only one source of truth.

The DevFlow unit tests parse `openapi.yaml` with OpenAPI tooling and validate YAML/JSON syntax plus `$ref` targets across this directory.

## Testing contracts

The public `Microsoft.Maui.DevFlow.Testing` package uses these provider-neutral contracts:

### Testing contract index

Every JSON document below has a stable `$id`; the `v1` name is not a promise that a newly required
semantic can be introduced without a new version or explicit capability negotiation. Status is
intentionally about the contract, not device qualification.

| Contract | Canonical document and stable ID | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Broker workflow operations | [broker-workflow-runs-v1.yaml](broker-workflow-runs-v1.yaml) (OpenAPI 3.1, `info.version: 1.0.0`) | Preview local-broker contract; explicit target and capability token required |

- [Executable MAUI flow v2](schemas/maui-flow-v2.json) — the authoritative payload in a
  Markdown `json maui-test` block.
- [Test plan v1](schemas/maui-test-plan-v1.json) — non-executable goals, safety constraints,
  reset requirements, side-effect policy, expected clean-state preconditions, compensator
  declarations, independent business-oracle declarations, acceptance criteria, and approval
  metadata.
- [Flow run report v1](schemas/maui-flow-run-report-v1.json) — bounded run, target, reset,
  expected/observed preconditions, side-effect admission decision, compensation/oracle evidence,
  outcome, ordered actionability/command/assertion step evidence, typed failure, and artifact
  facts. Failure evidence links back through additive `manifest.flowRun` metadata in `.mauitrace`
  v1; it never adds a ZIP entry or changes the evidence allow-list.
- [Test execution manifest v1](schemas/maui-test-execution-manifest-v1.json) — provider-neutral,
  redacted host, build, artifact, device, lifecycle, ownership, and occurrence facts. Artifact
  references are relative to the artifact root; the contract has no raw-log, prompt, secret,
  machine-name, user-name, absolute-path, or device-serial fields.
- [Flow triage v1](schemas/maui-flow-triage-v1.json) — deterministic classification, evidence
  sufficiency, retryability, repair policy, local-reproduction requirement, inert allowed next
  actions, stable fingerprints, fixed-code explanation, and a safe execution-manifest projection.
  It never copies arbitrary exception, log, prompt, app, or device text into trusted output.
- [Local reproduction v1](schemas/maui-local-reproduction-v1.json) — the imported artifact digest
  and broker-minted opaque identity, local manifest/report digests, failure and checkpoint
  fingerprints, exact-match reasons, and confined local artifact references. It explicitly records
  that no broker binding, proposal, approval, apply, validation, or rollback authority was persisted.
- [Preview qualification report v1](schemas/maui-preview-qualification-v1.json) — redacted
  Android engineering-preview gate evidence: corpus/package/tool/policy fingerprints, declared
  device/build/seed profiles, static/generated/device-backed sample separation, first-attempt
  stability, conservative confidence intervals, calibration, privacy/security results, reviews,
  feature flags, thresholds, exclusions, artifacts, and `pass`/`fail`/`not-qualified` reasons.
  It is accounting only: it does not replay, repair, apply source, invoke a model, or make a PR
  check required.
- [Artifact trust v1](schemas/maui-artifact-trust-v1.json) — provider-neutral imported-artifact
  identity namespace, integrity-only facts, provenance policy/verification outcomes, safe
  projection, and local-reproduction binding. It defines `untrusted`, `attested`, and
  `locally-reproduced`; only the final state may pass a future proposal policy gate.
- [Broker workflow run v1](schemas/broker-workflow-run-v1.json) — broker lifecycle, explicit
  agent-instance targeting, idempotency, and per-run capability-token contracts.
- [Broker artifact trust v1](schemas/broker-artifact-trust-v1.json) — bounded import,
  capability-gated status/safe-projection/local-reproduction routes with no raw-content endpoint.
- [Workflow command ledger](schemas/workflow-command-ledger.json) — agent-instance-bound begin/end
  control, contiguous command envelopes, bounded duplicate receipts, and unknown-completion fencing.
- [Repair proposal v1](schemas/maui-flow-repair-proposal-v1.json) and
  [repair outcome v1](schemas/maui-flow-repair-outcome-v1.json) — reviewable selector-repair
  evidence and immutable outcomes.
- [XAML source proposal v1](schemas/maui-xaml-source-proposal-v1.json) — a distinct,
  local-host-only proposal for one static literal `AutomationId` addition/replacement. Source
  approval and source grants never approve a flow repair; flow selector follow-up remains a
  separate reviewed proposal.
- [C# source proposal v1](schemas/maui-csharp-source-proposal-v1.json) — a distinct,
  Roslyn-proven proposal for one direct object-initializer or literal-assignment `AutomationId`
  change. It is advisory only: the broker never writes C# source; a native IDE host applies and
  acknowledges the exact forward or rollback patch hashes.
- [Restricted test-agent protocol v1](schemas/maui-test-agent-protocol-v1.json) — provider-neutral
  request envelope, exact target/process identity, revision/run correlation, provenance,
  read-capability and opaque human-issued mutation-grant binding, typed errors, and bounded audit
  fields. It is used only by `maui devflow mcp --profile test-agent`; it does not add provider,
  source, device-lifecycle, repair-apply, or generic automation authority.

Schema 2 is the current executable flow contract. Schema 1 remains readable by the package and
can be preview-normalized to schema 2 without writing a file or inventing fingerprints, source
anchors, IDs, revisions, or live validation facts. Schema 3 is intentionally not defined yet.
Compatible readers and writers preserve unknown extension fields. Plans, reports, and repair
documents are data contracts only: a plan never authorizes reset or device lifecycle execution.

Flow schema 2 includes an optional stable `stepId`. Current recorders assign and preserve it;
legacy flows continue to identify steps by `seq`. Report, selector-health, repair, and triage
references prefer `stepId` and retain the sequence fallback. Fingerprint rule
`maui-flow-fingerprints-v1` defines:

- `testIdentityFingerprint` for stable test and step identity;
- `incidentFingerprint` for the recurring failure identity, excluding run ID, timestamps, source
  revision, app-build occurrence facts, and report digest; and
- `occurrenceFingerprint` for one run/commit/report occurrence.

Reordering steps that retain stable `stepId` values does not change incident identity. Imported
evidence is always diagnostic-only in triage: it reports `repairEligible: false` and requires a
fresh matching local reproduction before the existing repair policy may be evaluated as eligible.

Required capabilities and semantics are declared by a plan rather than changing flow schema 2.
Hosts must reject an unsupported required semantic before any mutation is attempted.

### Restricted test-agent authorization

The restricted MCP profile requires an explicit `agentId` and `agentInstanceId` for every
effectful request. Mutation grants are opaque, short-lived, and single-use (or atomically bounded
for approved exploration) and bind actor/provider/channel, app build and seed state, plan/flow
revision/digest, action/selector/route/side-effect/value/count limits, expiration, nonce, and
policy version. UI text, logs, network content, Markdown, screenshots, and imported artifacts are
untrusted data; none may widen a grant or policy. The audit contract retains only bounded IDs and
digests. See [test-agent.md](../test-agent.md).

### Imported artifacts

Foreign reports and `.mauitrace` v1 bundles are untrusted data. Their embedded IDs and provenance
are inert metadata; internal hashes provide integrity only. The pure Testing evaluator performs no
remote attestation lookup. A trusted host may supply independently verified facts matching its
configured repository/workflow/commit/digest policy to reach `attested`, but that state grants no
execution, replay, repair, or source authority. A separate, newly executed local run must match
the current flow/app/target/failure facts to reach `locally-reproduced`. Broker imports are
capability-token gated, bounded, memory-only safe projections; raw content has no broad endpoint.

### Side-effect admission

`sideEffectPolicy` is one of `none`, `app-state-resettable`, `test-tenant-resettable`,
`compensated`, or `non-replayable`. The broker and Testing runtime use the same pure admission
decision before a mutation lease or device mutation:

- `none` requires matching declared/observed preconditions.
- `app-state-resettable` additionally requires successful app-state reset evidence and a matching
  app-state seed fingerprint. It deliberately asks for no backend proof, because the flow changed
  no backend for such proof to be about. Use it when an in-app reset surface restores app state
  without restarting the process.
- `test-tenant-resettable` additionally requires successful app-state **and** backend/test-data
  reset evidence and matching fingerprints. Claim it only when a backend test tenant really is
  reset; an app-only reset cannot satisfy it.
- `compensated` additionally requires either that reset evidence or a successful result for the
  plan's declared compensator.
- `non-replayable` rejects automatic replay and repair validation. A distinct
  `manualOneShotAuthorization` context flag can admit one human run, never a repair-eligible run.

The context/checkpoint contract covers app build, app-state seed, backend/test-data seed, route,
window, modal, locale, theme, orientation, display profile, and applicable collection-item key.
Missing or mismatched declared evidence fails admission. A required independent business oracle
must succeed before a run or repair can be represented as verified. The broker workflow-run start
and snapshot contracts carry the additive `plan`, `context`, and `admission` fields; schema-2
manual flow requests remain supported and report `sideEffectPolicy: "unspecified"` with
`repairEligibility: false`.

## Extension discovery

Agents can expose app-specific diagnostics or automation under `/api/v1/ext/{namespace}/...`. Extension namespaces use reverse-domain notation such as `com.example.diagnostics`.

Extensions are discovered through `GET /api/v1/agent/capabilities`. The response includes an `extensions` object keyed by namespace. Each extension descriptor includes:

- `version`: semantic version for the extension descriptor contract
- `description`: human-readable summary
- `tools[]`: self-describing tool descriptors with `name`, `description`, `method`, `path`, optional JSON Schema `parameters`, optional JSON Schema `returns`, and optional behavior `annotations`

`GET /api/v1/agent/status` includes an `extensions` marker with `count` and `hash`. Clients can cache extension descriptors by hash and avoid fetching full capabilities when the marker has not changed.
